## Character Practice Mod
This mod allows you to practice a sequence of stages related to a specific character. For example you can practice all of Sonic's stages exclusively back to back.

To begin, install the mod, then select it from your mod manager and configure the settings. From there you will be able to replace the "Boss Rush" game modes with specific practice sequences for any character.
Each character has the option to practice their stages only, or their stages along with their bosses. In either case, you will place all stages in the order they would appear during a story campaing.

This practice mod pairs well with [SA2 Story Style Upgrade](https://github.com/QueenSuzie/sa2-story-style-upgrades) which is a mod designed to set your character upgrades to what they would be during a brand new story campaign.

## Installation
This mod is compatible with the [SA2 Mod Manager.](https://github.com/X-Hax/SA-Mod-Manager) Download the latest release and place the folder inside the 7z archive within your SA2 mods folder. Then enable the mod in your mod manager.
